                <h2>welcome to nyanime!</h2>
                <p>this is an anime database based off of the much larger and more famous MyAnimeList database. this web application uses the Jikan REST API for all its data.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>why was this application made?</h3>
                <p>MyAnimeList is so full of information that is not really necessary for an average person who is just researching for something new to watch. due to this, nyanime was made to just showcase the essential details in a neater way than MyAnimeList. getting straight to the point, while looking much prettier!</p>

                <h3>notes about this web application</h3>
                <p>home page: the 'top random genre' chart displays the highest scored animes of a different genre every time the page is loaded.</p>
                <p>anime page: if there is a " ¯_(ツ)_/¯ " under any topic, it means there is no info on that specific item from Jikan/MyAnimeList.</p>
                <p>genres page: genre descriptions were not available through Jikan, so they were copied from MyAnimeList or made by me.</p>
                <p>numbers: scores, ranks, and popularities originate from MyAnimeList and rated by its millions of users.</p>
                <br>
                <p>slow page loads: because Jikan has an api rate limit of 3 requests per second, in order to prevent the page from crashing, pauses were implemented to overcome that issue.</p>
