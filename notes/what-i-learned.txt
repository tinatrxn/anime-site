server-side caching
- using cache.cached to cache api calls - so i dont have to repeatedly call it
- saves data in memory

flask sessions
- quick access of info between pages on website
- temporary - saved on server (not client)
- way to pass stuff around our server
- ** use session to save favourites!!!

reaching search via POST and GET
- was stuck for so long because i didn't realize that when paginating, the user
    reaches the page via GET
- fixed code to get the variables required to search - clear session or continue session

what i want to learn
- client-side caching
